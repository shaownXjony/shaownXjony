# Hi, I'm MD SHAOWN RAHMAN 👋  
**Computer Science Graduate | Data Science & Machine Learning | NLP | Computer Vision | Web Developer**

I’m a self-motivated Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in **machine learning, deep learning, NLP, data analytics, and web development**.  
My academic thesis introduced me to applied AI through **handwritten medical prescription recognition using CNNs**, and since then I’ve continued building real-world ML projects and interactive applications.

I am currently preparing for a **Master’s program** in intelligent, AI-driven systems and expanding my expertise through practical projects and professional certifications.
